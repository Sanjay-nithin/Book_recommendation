## 🧠 Recommendation method

The system uses a lightweight content-based scoring model implemented in `backend/books/views.py` under the `recommended_books` endpoint.

Signals and weights:
- Favorite-genre similarity (Jaccard): 0.40
- Saved-books genre similarity (Jaccard): 0.20
- Author match with any saved book: 0.15
- Rating normalized (0–5 → 0–1): 0.15
- Liked percentage normalized (0–100 → 0–1): 0.05
- Language match with the user’s preferred language: 0.05

Additional details:
- Already saved books are excluded from recommendations.
- Cold start (no favorites/saved books): falls back to top-rated books.
- Data assumptions: `Book.genres` is a list of strings, `rating` in [0, 5], `liked_percentage` in [0, 100].
- The weights are easy to tune inside `recommended_books()` if you want to prioritize different signals.
